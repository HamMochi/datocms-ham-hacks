    <p>Swicthes are devices that either complete or break the flow of electricity. Generally, switches have two states (opened and closed). Here is a switch in an open state.</p>

    <p>As you can see, the connection is broken when the button is in an open state. This means that electricity will not be able to flow through the button. On the other hand, the connection is complete when the button is in a closed state, allowing the electricity to flow.</p>
